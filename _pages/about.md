G'day! I'm a data scientist at [Swisscom](https://www.swisscom.ch/en/about/company/innovation/analytics-artificial-intelligence.html), a major telecom company in Switzerland.

I use this blog to share machine learning ideas and techniques I find interesting or, more likely, remind my future self of things I've forgotten :).
