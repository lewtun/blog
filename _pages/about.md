G'day! I'm a data scientist at [Swisscom](https://www.swisscom.ch/en/about/company/innovation/analytics-artificial-intelligence.html), a major teleco in Switzerland. I have several years of experience building machine learning-powered applications for startups and enterprises, mostly in the domains of time series and natural language processing.

In a previous life I was a [theoretical physicist](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Hc6MI0QAAAAJ&hl=en), where I developed quantum field theories to make sense of data from collider and dark matter experiments.

Outside of data science, I love playing guitar, trail running, and contributing to open-source projects.

I use this blog to share machine learning ideas and techniques that I find interesting or (more likely) to remind my future self of things I've forgotten :see_no_evil:.
