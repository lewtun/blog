G'day! My name is Lewis Tunstall and I'm a data scientist at [Swisscom](https://www.swisscom.ch/en/about/company/innovation/analytics-artificial-intelligence.html), where I apply machine learning techniques to solve business problems involving natural language and time series.

Before that, I worked in startups where I developed a no-code deep learning platform, streaming systems at scale, and an open-source library for topological data analysis.

In a former life, I was a theoretical physicist and obtained my PhD from the University of Adelaide, Australia. The focus of my research was on understanding the low-energy interactions of quarks and gluons.
