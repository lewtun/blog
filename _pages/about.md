G'day! I'm Lewis and welcome to my blog. I'm a data scientist with several years experience building machine learning-powered applications for Swiss startups and enterprises, mostly in the domains of natural language processing, time series, and topological data analysis.

Some public examples of my work include the development of the [Giotto AI](https://giotto.ai/) "no code" deep learning platform, integrating topological data analysis algorithms for the [giotto-tda](https://towardsdatascience.com/getting-started-with-giotto-learn-a-python-library-for-topological-machine-learning-451d88d2c4bc) library, and the implementation of a novel [anomaly detection algorithm](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1kWpyWOLxUYXJIV7EbLgslzCZ3cmN2uCZ) at Swiss Mobiliar. More recently, I've been applying Transformers to automate 

In a previous life I was a [theoretical physicist](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Hc6MI0QAAAAJ&hl=en), where I developed quantum field theories to make sense of data from collider and dark matter experiments.

Outside of work, I love playing guitar, trail running, and contributing to open-source projects.

I use this blog to "work in public", which means sharing machine learning ideas and techniques that are related to my current projects or (more often) to remind my future self of things I've forgotten, usually in the form of [TILs](https://lewtun.github.io/blog/categories/#til).
