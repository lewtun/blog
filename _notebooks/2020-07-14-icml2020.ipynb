    "This year I had the opportunity to attend the [International Conference on Machine Learning](https://icml.cc/) (ICML) and decided to highlight some of the talks I found especially interesting. Although the conference was hosted entirely online, this provided two key benefits over attending in person:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Clash resolution:** with [1,088 papers accepted](https://syncedreview.com/2020/06/01/icml-2020-announces-accepted-papers/#:~:text=Conference%20Industry-,ICML%202020%20Announces%20Accepted%20Papers,the%20prestigious%20machine%20learning%20conference.), it is inevitable that multiple talks of interest would clash in the timetable. Watching the pre-recorded presentations on my own time provided a simple solution, not to mention the ability to quickly switch to a new talk if desired.\n",
    "* **Better Q&A sessions:** at large conferences it is not easy to get your questions answered directly after a talk, usually because the whole session is running overtime and the moderator wants to move onto the next speaker. By having two (!) dedicated Q&A sessions for each talk, I found the discussions to be extremely insightful and much more personalised.\n",

    "This talk shows that with enough compute, it is possible to adapt transformer architectures to images and achieve strong results in self-supervised learning benchmarks. Dubbed iGPT, this approach relies on a three-step process:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Downsize the images, cluster the RGB pixel values to create a 9-bit colour map, and reshape to 1D.{% fn 1 %}\n",

The authors go on to show that their formulation can also be used to express transformers as RNNs, which might be an interesting way to explore the [shortcomings](https://mostafadehghani.com/2019/05/05/universal-transformers/) of these large langauge models."

    "In this talk, the authors introduce the [XTREME benchmark](https://sites.research.google/xtreme) to evaluate the ability of multilingual representations to generalise across 40 languages and 9 tasks. To evaluate a model in XTREME, the main idea is to follow a three-stage recipe:\n",

    "2. Fine-tune on English data for each task.\n",
    "3. Evaluate the model on _zero-shot transfer_ performance, e.g. evaluate the accuracy on a German text classification task.\n",
    "\n",
    "English is chosen for fine-tuning because it's the langauge with the most labelled data, and the authors employ a neat trick using Google Translate to generate proxy test sets for the tasks where a pre-existing translation does not exist. \n",
    "\n",
    "Although not strictly about Transformers, the baseline models for this benchmark are all variants of the Transformer architecture, and the authors find that [XLM-R](https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.02116) achieves the best zero-shot transfer performance across all languages in each task. What I especially like about XTREME is that the tasks are designed to be trainable on a single GPU for less than a day. This should make it possible for research labs with tight budgets to create competitive models, where the gains in performance are likely to come from architectural design rather than simply scaling-up the compute.\n",

    "I'm excited about this benchmark because I expect it will produce models that have a direct impact on my professional work in Switzerland. With [four national languages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Languages_of_Switzerland) and a smattering of English, building natural language applications that serve the whole population is a constant challenge."
