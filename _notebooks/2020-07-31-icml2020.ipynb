    "This year I had the opportunity to attend the [International Conference on Machine Learning](https://icml.cc/) (ICML) and decided to highlight some of the talks I found especially interesting. Although the conference was hosted entirely online, this provided two key benefits over attending in person:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Clash resolution:** with [1,088 papers accepted](https://syncedreview.com/2020/06/01/icml-2020-announces-accepted-papers/#:~:text=Conference%20Industry-,ICML%202020%20Announces%20Accepted%20Papers,the%20prestigious%20machine%20learning%20conference.), it is inevitable that multiple talks of interest would clash in the timetable. Watching the pre-recorded presentations in my own time provided a simple solution, not to mention the ability to quickly switch to a new talk if desired.\n",
    "* **Better Q&A sessions:** at large conferences it is not easy to get your questions answered directly after a talk, usually because the whole session is running overtime and the moderator wants to move onto the next speaker. By having two (!) dedicated Q&A sessions for each talk, I found the discussions to be extremely insightful and much more personalised.\n",

What I especially like about XTREME is that the tasks are designed to be trainable on a single GPU for less than a day. This should make it possible for research labs with tight budgets to create competitive models, where the gains in performance are likely to come from architectural design rather than simply scaling-up the compute.\n",

With [four national languages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Languages_of_Switzerland) and a smattering of English, building natural language applications that serve the whole population is a constant challenge."

A sample ratio parameter $r_s$ controls the ratio of negative to positive sample sizes and acts as a sort of hyperparameter or threshold that is tuned.\n",
